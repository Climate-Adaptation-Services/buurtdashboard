I want to refactor code in this project.

Target: [file/component/module to refactor]
Goal: [what you want to improve - readability, performance, maintainability, etc.]

Please:
1. Analyze the current implementation
2. Identify code smells or issues
3. Suggest refactoring approaches
4. Ensure the refactoring maintains existing functionality
5. Update tests if needed
