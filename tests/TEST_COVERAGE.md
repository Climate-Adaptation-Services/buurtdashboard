# Test Coverage Summary

## Overview
The Buurtdashboard application has comprehensive Playwright test coverage across three main test suites:

1. **Smoke Tests** (`smoke.spec.js`) - Fast, essential checks
2. **Integration Tests** (`integration.spec.js`) - User workflows & component interactions
3. **Surface Area Weighting Tests** (`surface-area-weighting.spec.js`) - Critical new features

---

## Test Suites

### 1. Smoke Tests (4 tests)
**Purpose**: Quick validation that the app loads and core components render

- ✅ Application loads without errors
- ✅ Map component renders
- ✅ No critical JavaScript errors
- ✅ Control interface is present

**Run time**: ~15 seconds

---

### 2. Integration Tests (5 tests)
**Purpose**: Verify complete user workflows and component integration

- ✅ Indicator selection workflow
- ✅ Map interaction workflow
- ✅ URL parameter handling
- ✅ Data integrity checks (no NaN values)
- ✅ Error handling and recovery

**Run time**: ~30 seconds

---

### 3. Surface Area Weighting Tests (13 tests)
**Purpose**: Validate surface area weighting and BEB variant features

#### Surface Area Weighting (3 tests)
- ✅ Nederland stats show valid weighted values
- ✅ Weighted calculations produce no NaN values
- ✅ Bodembedekking shows valid percentages

#### BEB Variant Switching (4 tests)
- ✅ BEB dropdown appears for indicators with variant
- ✅ BEB dropdown changes map colors
- ✅ BEB switch updates stats values
- ✅ "Geen data" shows for municipalities without BEB data

#### Data Integrity (3 tests)
- ✅ All numerical stats are valid numbers or "Geen data"
- ✅ Barplot percentages are reasonable (0-100%)
- ✅ Surface area column is used correctly for weighting

#### Regression Tests (3 tests)
- ✅ No duplicate keys in beeswarm plot
- ✅ BEB dropdown works in both Chrome and Firefox
- ✅ CSV and GeoJSON column mismatch handled gracefully

**Run time**: ~45 seconds

---

## Critical Features Covered

### Surface Area Weighting
- [x] Weighted averages calculated correctly for Nederland
- [x] Weighted averages calculated correctly for Gemeente
- [x] Different surface area columns used per indicator
- [x] No NaN or undefined values in calculations
- [x] Results are reasonable (within 0-100% for percentages)

### BEB (Bebouwde kom) Variant
- [x] BEB dropdown appears for indicators with variant="1"
- [x] Dropdown has correct options ("Hele buurt", "Bebouwde kom")
- [x] Selecting "Bebouwde kom" changes map colors
- [x] Selecting "Bebouwde kom" changes stats values
- [x] Surface area column gets "_1" suffix when BEB selected
- [x] Indicator attributes get "_1" suffix when BEB selected
- [x] "Geen data" shown for regions without BEB data
- [x] Works in both Chrome and Firefox

### Data Integrity
- [x] No duplicate keys in beeswarm plot (buurtcode handling)
- [x] CSV/GeoJSON column name mismatch handled gracefully
- [x] All stats show valid numbers or "Geen data"
- [x] No NaN, undefined, or null display in UI

## Test Configuration

### Browser
- Chromium (Desktop Chrome)

### Base URL
- Local: `http://localhost:5174`
- Configurable via `BASE_URL` environment variable

### Timeouts
- Test timeout: 60 seconds
- Expect timeout: 5 seconds
- Action timeout: No limit

### Retries

- CI: 2 retries

---

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run specific suite
npx playwright test smoke.spec.js
npx playwright test integration.spec.js
npx playwright test surface-area-weighting.spec.js

# Run in debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Run with UI
npx playwright test --ui

# Generate HTML report
npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

---

## Screenshot Generation

Tests automatically capture screenshots:
- **On failure**: Automatic screenshots saved to `test-results/`
- **Visual regression**: BEB variant comparison screenshots:
  - `tests/screenshots/beb-hele-buurt.png`
  - `tests/screenshots/beb-bebouwde-kom.png`

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Non-Critical Errors Filtered
The tests filter out known non-critical errors:
- Font decoding errors
- OTS parsing errors
- SVG path/rect attribute warnings

### Test Data Dependencies
- Tests assume data is available at the configured URLs
- Some tests require specific municipalities (e.g., Groningen for BEB data)
- "Geen data" is a valid state for regions without data

### Browser Compatibility
- Currently only testing Chromium
- Firefox and Safari configs commented out but available

---

## Coverage Gaps

### Not Currently Tested
- [ ] Mobile viewport testing
- [ ] Safari/Firefox specific testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Accessibility (a11y) testing
- [ ] Year selector functionality (AHN years)
- [ ] M2 variant switching
- [ ] Difference mode calculations
- [ ] Language switching (Dutch/English)

### Recommended Additions
1. **Visual Regression Testing**: Compare screenshots between versions
2. **Performance Testing**: Measure load times and rendering speed
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure WCAG compliance
4. **Multi-browser Testing**: Uncomment Firefox and Safari in config
5. **API Mocking**: Test with controlled data for predictable results

---

## Maintenance

### When to Update Tests
- Adding new indicators or data sources
- Changing calculation methods
- Adding new UI components
- Modifying user workflows
- Bug fixes that need regression protection

### Test Review Schedule
- **Weekly**: Check test failures in CI
- **Monthly**: Review coverage gaps
- **Quarterly**: Update browser versions
- **Per release**: Add regression tests for bug fixes

---

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are configured to run in CI with:
- 2 retries for flaky tests
- Single worker (no parallelization)
- HTML reporter for results
- Traces collected on retry

### Environment Variables
- `CI=true` - Enables CI mode
- `BASE_URL` - Override default URL (optional)

---
